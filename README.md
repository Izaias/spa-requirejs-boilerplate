# SPA RequireJS Boilerplate âš¡
Basic files for building SPAs with RequireJS.
# Why?
It makes no sense having to recreate the basics everytime I start a new project or prototype.

#How?
Just clone the repo, run `npm install` and then `npm start` and watch the magic happen. The command relies on the scripts inside the package.json to get everything ready for you.

#What?
A simple tool built to automate the repetitive process of creating those very basic files I need on every new project.

#References?
Here https://goo.gl/dV0Pke is a brief summary (PT-BR only) of the studies that I did to learn how to build this tool.
